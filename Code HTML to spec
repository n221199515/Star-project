      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>AKA, The Ratel (seriously this time</h3>
      <p>The honey badger (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel,
        is the only species in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelid>mustelid</a>
        subfamily Mellivorinae and its only genus Mellivora. It is native to
        Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name,
        the honey badger does not closely resemble other badger species;
        instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels.</p>

      <h3>Characteristics</h3>
      <article>
        <p>The honey badger has a fairly long body, but is distinctly
          thick-set and broad across the back. Its skin is remarkably loose,
          and allows it to turn and twist freely within it.</p>

      <aside>The honey badger has short and sturdy legs, with five toes on each foot.</aside>
